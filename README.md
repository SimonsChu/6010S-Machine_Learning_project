This project focuses on the IMDB sentiment analysis

Task description:
IMDB dataset having 50K movie reviews for natural language processing or Text analytics. This isa dataset for binary sentiment classification containing substantially more data than previousbenchmark datasets. It provides a set of 25,000 highly polar movie reviews for training and 25,000for testing. So, predict the number of positive and negative reviews using either classification ordeep learning algorithms.For more dataset information, please go through the following link,http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/

Here I uesed MLP,RNN,LSTM three models to do the sentiment analysis and the LSTM model got the best results. 
I also output the model and model weight in the h5 files. Since the MLP model h5 file is too large, so I just upload the RNN and LSTM models.
